# Assignment 5- Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Objective

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, including Third Party APIs - [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/).

## Product

The simple calendar application displays current timer at the top, and timeblocks from 9 am to 5 pm are colour coded (All hours from 9 am to current hour are grey, current hour is red and all hours from current hour to 5 pm are green). The functionality of the application is in line with acceptance criteria, however, the application design is different from the demo provided. 

## User Story

```md

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
